## Flooding of the Elbe

In this project the focus will be on Elbe flood in 2002 and in particular on the area on the 
area between the cities of Torgau and Aken which were most severely hit.

The Elbe is a river with a length of nearly 1100 km, with a catchment area of about 150,000 
km2. The river flows into the North Sea. About 2/3 of the catchment area is located in 
Germany, 1/3 in the Czech Republic, and a small part in Austria and Poland. About 25 million 
people live in the area. About 7.5 million of them live in the five largest cities: Berlin, 
Hamburg, Prague, Dresden and Leipzig . 

Two low pressure areas shortly after each other in August, poured enormous amounts of 
rain over central Europe. Rainfall events of sometimes over 150 mm per day were recorded 
in areas where usually less than that falls in the whole month of August. The Dresden 
weather station recorded 158 mm on August 12 and Zinnwald 312 mm . There were flash 
floods in mountainous tributaries of the Elbe (smaller rivers flowing into the Elbe) , like the 
Upper Mulde and Weisseritz .
