In our project, we will determine the state of the river before the flood and during the flood 
and note the differences in the areas and what are the risks that occurred during that 
period, through a program Arcgis , so we need to download pictures of the geographical 
maps from the American sites ( https://www.usgs.gov/ ) In our case the data is ready .

## The steps : 

- The data was downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) . 
- We decompress the files and then we bring the data to a program ArcGis 
- windows _ Image Anlaysis _ we define the Bands then Composile Bands 
- We define the area to be analyzed by Rectancal located in the toolbar Drawing
- Arc Toolbox _ Spailal analyst tools _ iso Cluster Unsupervised Classification number of classes about = 6 

Enviroments processing _ Extent _ same as layer Area _ applay 

- The last layer _ Layer properties _ we define all layers in the new file to be No color except for the 
first layer then the course of the river is determined. 

- There were major problems due to shadows in terrain so :

Arc toolbox _ Spaial analyst tools _ Reclass _ Reclassify _ input raster (the first layer) we put all the 
values in a column( New values) = 2 except that the first row = 1 and we apply. 

- We delete all the water areas surrounding the river and within the study area until the course of the river remains.

- Arc Toolbox _ From Raster _ Raster to polygon _ Ok. 

- The last layer in Table of contens - Symbology - gridcode _ add all values _ ok.
 
- The last Layer - Open Alttribute Table - select by attributes _  we put gridcode = 2 then we delet all select values. 

- Now , we have to examine our Data and remove the erros due to shadows in terrain.

- We apply the same steps to the second file and then we take the river flood layer and we merge with the river in the normal position 
 and then we have a map before and after the flood . 
 
- Add Basemap _ Imagerie then add (title, legend, etc).


## Discussion:

In Germany, floods are dealt with in what is known as the (Hochwasserschutzstrategien ) flood 
response strategy . 

This strategy is divided into:

Flood prone area management - prediction and advance planning techniques - flood response techniques.

## Notes and suggestions:

♦ Building a group of dams along the river course .
♦ Building blocking barriers on the edge of the river .
♦ Cleaning the phrases and repairing them continuously .
♦ Some layers must be dug on both sides of the river for the water to leak .
♦ Avoid the presence of residential areas on the edge of the river .
♦ Constant maintenance of water installations and wadis ducts . 
♦ It is advisable before flooding to prepare an emergency bag containing lamp, radio, batteries, first aid kit in addition to food, water bottles and whistle.
♦ But after the end of the flood, it is necessary to be very careful in dealing with the purposes that the flood water has reached, 
  as it is recommended that children's toys be washed well and not eat foods that have been exposed to the flood water, 
  as it is not recommended to drink directly from the water taps and preferably only drink bottled water.

In the end we can say, floods are a natural phenomenon and cannot be prevented, but the extent of their risks can be reduced.
